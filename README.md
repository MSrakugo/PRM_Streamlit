# GUI Application for Protolith Reconstruction Models (PRMs)

## Overview
This project introduces a **Graphical User Interface (GUI) application for Protolith Reconstruction Models (PRMs)**, developed in Python and Streamlit. It employs **machine learning algorithms** to reconstruct the protolith composition and quantify element transfer.

This application not only allows users to **easily handle PRMs** through a user-friendly GUI but also offers **tools for the normalization and visualization of compositional data** through simple file drop functionality.

## Paper
This methodology is based on the research paper:
* Matsuno, S., Uno, M., Okamoto, A. et al. Machine-learning techniques for quantifying the protolith composition and mass transfer history of metabasalt. Sci Rep 12, 1385 (2022). [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05109-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05109-x)

Key words: **Geochemistry, Fluid-rock interaction, Element transfer, Quantitative evaluation, Machine-learning techniques**

## Features
* **Protolith Reconstruction Models (PRMs)**: Estimate the protolith composition (default model: for basalt trace-element compositions) from a limited number of input elements of altered/metamorphosed samples with high accuracy.
  * The default models are constructed based on LightGBM algorithms and trained with datasets for various types of basalts, including mid-ocean ridge, ocean-island, and volcanic arc basalts.
  * In the near future, we plan to update this application to enable model construction with your customized datasets.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitively designed, making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
