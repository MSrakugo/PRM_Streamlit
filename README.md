# PRM_Application

## Overview
This project presents a **Graphical User Interface (GUI) application** developed in Python and Streamlit, based on the research paper "Machine-learning techniques for quantifying the protolith composition and mass transfer history of metabasalt" by Satoshi Matsuno, Masaoki Uno, Atsushi Okamoto, and Noriyoshi Tsuchiya.
Our tool utilizes **machine learning algorithms** to reconstruct the protolith composition and quantify element transfer, espesially for metabasalt.

## Paper
This methodology is based on
* Matsuno, S., Uno, M., Okamoto, A. et al. Machine-learning techniques for quantifying the protolith composition and mass transfer history of metabasalt. Sci Rep 12, 1385 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05109-x

Key words: **Geochemistry, Fluid-rock interaction, Element transfer, Quantitative evaluation, Machine-learning techniques**

## Features
1. Protolith Reconstruction Models (PRMs)**: Estimate protolith composition (default model: for  basalt trace-element compositions) from a limited number of input elements of altered/metamorphosed samples with high accuracy.
  * The default models constructed based on the algorithms of LightGBM learned the datasets for various types of basalts, including mid-ocean ridge, ocean-island, and volcanic arc basalts.
  * In near future, we update the this application for constructing models by your suitable datasets.
1. **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be intuitive and accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
